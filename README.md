# Emotify

## Overview
This project implements an innovative music player that uses facial expression recognition to tailor music selections to the user's emotional state, enhancing the overall music listening experience.

## Features
- Real-time facial expression recognition using webcam
- Emotion detection for happy, sad, angry, and neutral states
- Customized playlist generation based on detected emotion
- Intuitive user interface for seamless interaction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe
- Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2.  Install required dependencies

## Usage
1. Run the main script

2. Allow webcam access when prompted
3. The system will detect your emotion and start playing appropriate music

## Algorithm
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial expression recognition. The CNN is trained using stochastic gradient descent and cross-validation techniques.

## Future Scope
- Enhance facial recognition accuracy
- Expand recognized emotions
- Develop mobile applications
- Implement user personalization
- Integrate biometric inputs
- Enable user feedback for continuous improvement
